# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe in C

> A classic, terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed purely in C, with ambitious plans to become a logic challenge featuring an unbeatable AI and the complex "Super Tic-Tac-Toe" mode.

This project starts as a simple implementation of the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe for two local players, running directly in the terminal. The goal is to build a solid foundation in C for future expansions, including a single-player mode against an AI and the intriguing Super Tic-Tac-Toe mode.

### üé≤ Rules of Super Tic-Tac-Toe (Future Implementation)

Super Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe) takes the challenge to a new level. The board is a giant 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid, where each of the 9 cells is a smaller, regular Tic-Tac-Toe board.

1.  The first player can place an 'X' in any of the 81 available cells.
2.  The position of your move on the small board determines which of the large boards your opponent **must** play in on their next turn.
3.  To win the game, you need to win 3 small boards in a row, column, or diagonal on the giant board.
